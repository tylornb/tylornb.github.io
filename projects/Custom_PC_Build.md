## Project Overview

Building my own computer from scratch was one of the most significant projects that I did outside of classwork. The goal was to design and assemble a PC that could handle academic work such as programming, simulation, and multitasking, as well as personal use. This required doing research on compatible parts, comparing specifications, and balancing the performance of parts with the cost. I had to ensure that I bought parts that would fit together both physically and electronically. The project was much more than just shopping. I had to actually understand how each part worked and whether they worked together.

## My Role
My role in the project was to plan, purchase, and assemble the build. I was solely responsible for making decisions on compatibility, budget trade-offs, and performance. The manufacturers provided the parts that I bought, but the challenge was putting them together. The assembly process required care and precision, such as installing the CPU without damaging the pins, attaching the cooler with thermal paste, managing power cords, and fitting everything inside the case. After the initial build, I noticed that airflow was poor, and at high GPU usage, the unit would get to a high temperature, so I adjusted the fan placement a couple of times and found a configuration that significantly improved the cooling.

## Lessons Learned
From doing this project, I learned much more about computer hardware than I thought I would. Some things I gained a much better understanding of were how GPUs and CPUs interact, the importance of airflow in cooling, and how it can affect overall performance. Beyond technical skills, I’ve gained more confidence in handling hardware challenges and in approaching technical problems methodically. This project gave me practical experience that I can carry into the future.
