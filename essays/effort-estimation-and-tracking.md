## Effort Estimation Approach
I estimated effort in half-hour units while planning the milestone, primarily basing the estimates on similar prior work, especially the WODs. Doing the WODs and estimating their time helped establish a baseline sense of how long similar tasks would take, but as the project progressed, I relied more on comparing new issues to previous similar ones.

When estimating an issue, I would think about what needed to be implemented and roughly how complex each part would be. I typically estimated slightly higher than my initial intuition, for any uncertainties, which was often necessary. However, many factors still caused the estimates to be off, especially merge conflicts during early development and more extensive testing than I did during the WODs.

## Benefits and Limitations of Estimating in Advance
Estimating effort in advance was quite useful, but it was occasionally stressful. Estimates helped me understand how much time I would need to dedicate to an issue, which let me plan out my week accordingly. In the final milestone especially, estimating helped me realize that I needed to spread my tasks across the week better rather than completing them in a few sessions close to the due date.

However, when an issue expanded beyond its expected scope, estimates sometimes became a source of pressure, especially when I was going far beyond my initial estimate. Despite this, estimating still provided much more value by making the overall scope of work more visible.

## Tracking Actual Effort
For each issue, I recorded the approximate start and stop times by checking the clock at the beginning and end of a work session. While this method was not perfectly precise, it gave a decent approximation of time spent per issue and allowed comparison between estimated and actual effort. Over time, I realized that many tasks like debugging, refactoring, and resolving merge conflicts consistently took longer than I expected.

## Reflection and Improvements
For future projects, I would include extra buffer time for testing and potential problems like merge conflicts. I would also use a more accurate way of measuring my actual effort to better create future estimates, like using the WakaTime VSCode extension, which automatically tracks time spent coding.

## Use of AI Tools
I used ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5) occasionally during the project. In the early milestones, I asked for rough time estimates after explaining what an issue involved, spending about five minutes per interaction. However, these estimates were often much lower than the actual time required, so I stopped using AI for generating time estimates after the first milestone.

Later, especially during milestone 3, I used ChatGPT to help identify the different components I would need to create or modify. I then produced my own estimates based on the breakdown, which gave me estimates closer to the actual effort required.
