## Why Coding Standards Matter
When people talk about coding standards, the topic is often reduced to the nitpicky details like how many spaces to indent or putting a blank line at the end of the program. But from my own experience, I've realized that coding standards are far from the trivial points most think about. Coding standards can help in learning a programming language because they provide consistency in things like structure, making it easier to understand what's happening in the code and easier to implement code with a similar structure. Even when programmers write code in different ways, having shared standards narrows down the endless possibilities of how people can write code. Reading code that has shared standards shifts the focus away from trying to solve a puzzle of what it would look like in normal coding standards, and more towards actually understanding what the code is doing.

## First Impressions of ESLint and VSCode
After my first week with both VSCode and ESLint, I’ve noticed that they can shape the way I write my code. However, at the same time, I do think that ESLint errors can be very painful to resolve. Sometimes I feel like I spend more time trying to fix the ESLint stylistic errors than actually coding. Overall, though, I do think that the corrections being made are to push programmers towards better habits. Even though it seems like many small annoyances, the stylistic corrections make the code look much cleaner, read smoother, and make it easier to debug. When everything you code looks uniform in specific ways, mistakes like a missing closing bracket become much easier to spot. 


## Final Thoughts
Overall, I’ve figured out that coding standards and tools like ESLint are more than just rules about style. They help a programmer build and maintain better habits that make code much easier to read back. This cleaner code not only looks nicer, but also makes the process of debugging and learning a programming language much more consistent. While I'm still early in my ESLint and VSCode experience, I think that complying with common coding standards is the best way to grow as a proficient programmer.
