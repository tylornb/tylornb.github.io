## Introduction
Artificial intelligence has become a very common tool in education, especially in software engineering, where it can help with learning, reduce repetitive work, and can help clarify complex ideas. In ICS 314, AI played an important role in how I approached coding, learning new technologies, and managing the workload of the course.

Before ICS 314, I had already viewed AI as a helpful academic tool, having used it to create flashcards or explain concepts in different ways. In this course, I mainly used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. My overall attitude towards AI stayed mostly the same, but I learned more about its strengths and limitations, especially in a software engineering context.

## Personal Experience with AI
I used AI regularly for the experience and in-class practice WODs. In these cases, I typically asked AI to generate functions based on the instructions or to help fix syntax errors when I got stuck. This boosted my learning and productivity, allowing me to continue moving forward without spending excessive amounts of time on syntax issues.

During graded in-class WODs, I initially avoided AI. The first in-class WOD I timed out on was also the only one where I didn’t use AI. At the time, my TypeScript syntax skills were still developing. That experience reinforced the idea that AI speeds up coding not because it removes thinking, but because describing behavior in English, most of the time, is much faster than implementing it in syntax.

For essays, I used AI mainly for outlining and revisions. AI does write clearly, but it sometimes alters my voice too much with edit suggestions or introduces inaccurate information, so I treated it more as a structural tool rather than a content generator.

In the final project, I used AI for understanding parts of the tech stack I was still not very familiar with, creating code, and debugging issues. One of the main things I used it for was to understand the Next.js starter template and understand teammates’ implementations, which helped avoid conflicts. However, I avoided using AI for higher-level design decisions.

When learning new, unfamiliar concepts, like how to use a database, I asked AI-specific questions to get unstuck quickly. This was situationally helpful, as sometimes AI explanations were clearer than the documentation, but other times were less accurate and needed verification.

I also used AI for coding examples, especially earlier in the semester, to see ways the WODs could be completed, other than the professor’s demonstrations. For writing code, I used AI agents in VS Code to make and edit code; however, I often needed to make small changes afterward. One area where AI excelled most of the time was in documentation, producing helpful comments and good README drafts that only needed minor edits.

For quality assurance, I used AI to help fix syntax and ESLint errors when I did not understand what the error was. However, sometimes, AI suggested incorrect fixes, possibly introducing more problems by overcomplicating situations.

Though AI increased my confidence during coding, this confidence felt somewhat artificial. I was more confident in producing working code more quickly, but not necessarily more confident in my syntax skills. Instead, it helped with improving my confidence in higher-level software engineering tasks, like understanding and navigating a codebase, integrating with teammates' work, and reasoning about how different parts of the system fit together.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI improved both my productivity and understanding of software engineering concepts. It provided a fast way to resolve specific problems and changed how I approached coding problems. Instead of focusing immediately on syntax, I learned to think more in terms of describing program behavior.

## Practical Applications
Outside of ICS 314, I have used AI in other classes for tasks like creating flashcards to study and checking algorithm logic. This course taught me that using AI effectively largely depends on the quality of the prompt given to the AI. Being very specific about requirements is especially important when working with code so that missing features and unnecessary complexity are avoided.

## Challenges and Opportunities
The main challenges with AI are its tendency to overcomplicate solutions or make up details when prompts are not specific enough. AI also often generates code that is harder to read than necessary. These limitations highlight the necessity of understanding the syntax and overall code well enough to correct AI mistakes.

## Comparative Analysis
Compared to classes that don't allow the use of AI, my engagement level was about the same. AI did not replace the essential skills like setting up databases, using GitHub, or how to manage a full tech stack. However, it did reduce the tedious, repetitive tasks and shortened the time I got stuck on minor issues, which allowed me to focus more on system-level understanding.

## Future Considerations
The way AI is integrated into ICS 314 feels appropriate. Earlier courses should, and do, focus on learning more of the syntax and fundamentals without AI. Once those basics are established, AI becomes a powerful tool that boosts productivity rather than hindering learning. However,  students still need to understand things like how code works and how systems are organized to do well in the class.

## Conclusion
Overall, my experience using AI in ICS 314 was a net positive, allowing me to focus less on mastering syntax and more on higher-level software engineering concepts. My recommendation to future students is to learn the fundamentals well enough to be able to understand and correct AI-generated code. When used thoughtfully, AI can enhance learning and productivity without replacing many of the critical thinking skills a software engineer must have.
