# Building Skills in Software Engineering


## Interests/Intro
At first, I was drawn to software engineering because it seemed like a stable, in-demand career path that paid well. At the time, I wasn’t very passionate about the field itself. However, I have always been surrounded by computers and technology since I was little, and I’ve always been curious about how they work - software included. Over time, I’ve found that there are parts of software engineering that I genuinely enjoy. Working on code from scratch and seeing a functioning piece of software that I made is extremely satisfying, especially once I have all the knowledge to complete it.

## Accuracy and speed

One of my main priorities in software engineering is to improve my coding accuracy and speed. Right now, I get slowed down by small logic or syntax mistakes, but I want to reach the point where I can code more smoothly and naturally. Timed coding exercises called WODs, like short practice projects, provide a clear way to measure this progress, since they emphasize both accuracy and efficiency under pressure. 

## Teamwork and Collaboration

Another skill I want to focus on is teamwork and collaboration. Most software engineering projects rely on groups of people sharing ideas, dividing tasks, and communicating effectively. I want to grow more comfortable with working in these environments, not only by contributing my own ideas, but also by listening actively and supporting others. Another area I want to continue developing is my technical writing skills. In most cases, it isn't enough to just write the code. Software engineers are expected to explain their reasoning, document projects, and communicate with others in a clear and concise manner. Whether it is through essays, code documentation, or project notes, these opportunities give me valuable ways to improve my writing.

## Future experiences and goals

Looking beyond the classroom, I want to pursue internships and work on real-world applications. I believe that internships are one of the most important opportunities because they provide first-hand experience of how professional teams operate and how software is developed on a large scale. I think that real-world software will feel very different from classroom assignments, because they are used by actual people and have a practical impact, which makes the work more meaningful to me. I am particularly interested in combining my computer science degree with my minor in marine biology. This combination is what excites me the most about my future in computer science. Right now, my dream job would be to work as a software engineer for a program like Nautilus, since my main interest in marine biology is deep-sea life. Being able to apply software engineering in a way that supports marine exploration or deep-sea research would be the perfect way to bring together my major, minor, and personal interests.
